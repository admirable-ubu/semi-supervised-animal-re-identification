# Semi-Supervised Classification With Pairwise Constraints: A Case Study on Animal Re-identification from Video

## 1. Data

The data is from repository: [Animal Re-Identification from Video](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7322820).

## 2. Code for ...

## 3. Code for the constrained clustering (MATLAB)

The code is in folder MATLAB. It needs the data files for the five videos (bounding boxes and constraints). They are named as in the data repository [Animal Re-Identification from Video](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7322820) and stored in folder “features/features”.
